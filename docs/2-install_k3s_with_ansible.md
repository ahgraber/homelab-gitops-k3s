# :sailboat:&nbsp; Installing k3s with Ansible

k3s can be automatically installed via Terraform provisioner, or manually leverage the playbook.

See [homelab-terraform](https://github.com/ahgraber/homelab-terraform) to use Ansible as a Terraform
provisioner to install k3s, or
[Ansible instructions](https://github.com/ahgraber/homelab-terraform/blob/main/docs/3%20-%20ansible.md)
to manually run the playbook.
