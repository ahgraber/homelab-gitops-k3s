:round_pushpin: Here we will be installing [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) after some quick
bootstrap steps.

> [Here](https://fluxcd.io/docs/flux-e2e/) is flux's explanation of its end-to-end commit flow.

## 1. Verify Flux can be installed

```sh
flux --kubeconfig=$(pwd)/kubeconfig check --pre
```

## 2. Pre-create the `flux-system` namespace

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig="${KUBECONFIG}" create namespace flux-system --dry-run=client -o yaml | \
  kubectl --kubeconfig="${KUBECONFIG}" apply -f -
```

## 3. Add the Age key in-order for Flux to decrypt SOPS secrets

```sh
# cat ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt |
cat "${SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE}" |
    kubectl --kubeconfig="${KUBECONFIG}" \
    -n flux-system create secret generic sops-age \
    --from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin
```

## 4. Create deploy key & add to github

Generate key with :

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -C "github-deploy-key" -f ./cluster/github-deploy-key -q -P ""
```

Copy contents of `cluster/github-deploy-key.pub` to `deploy keys` section of github repo
`https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>/settings/keys`

## 4. Export more environment variables for application configuration

> _Note:_ Exported variables go into `./tmpl/...`, where there are exported to settings and secrets
> in the next step

Here is a code blurb to quickly copy environmental variables into your .envrc. If using, **edit
before running or copying exports into .envrc**

```sh
cat >> .envrc << EOF

# The repo you created from this template
export BOOTSTRAP_GITHUB_REPOSITORY="https://github.com/ahgraber/homelab-gitops-k3s"
export GITHUB_USER="ahgraber"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="qwertyuiop123456789"
export BOOTSTRAP_DEFAULT_USER="admin"
export BOOTSTRAP_DEFAULT_EMAIL="k8s-at-home@gmail.com"
export BOOTSTRAP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="changeme"

# Choose one of your domains or use a made up one
export BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN="DOMAIN.COM"
# Cloudflare API token for DNS certification
export BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL="k8s-at-home@gmail.com"
export BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN="kpG6iyg3FS_du_8KRShdFuwfbwu3zMltbvmJV6cD"

# Pick a range of *UNUSED* IPs that are on the same network as your nodes
# Note: these cannot overlap with the kube-vip IP
export BOOTSTRAP_LB_INGRESS="10.42.42.43"
export BOOTSTRAP_LB_RANCHER="10.42.42.44"
export SETTINGS_LB_MARIADB="10.42.42.45"
export SETTINGS_LB_POSTGRES="10.42.42.46"
export BOOTSTRAP_LB_DEFAULT_RANGE="10.42.42.200-10.42.42.242"


# Generate hashed user/password for traefik basicauth
export TRAEFIK_BASICAUTH='$(htpasswd -nb <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> | openssl base64)'
EOF
```

## 5. Create required files based on ALL exported environment variables

General procedure:

```zsh
# reload all env variables
direnv allow .

# create SOPS hook for secret encryption
envsubst < /path/to/templatefile.yaml.tmpl >! /path/to/outputfile.yaml
```

To run for all templates in repo:

```sh
bash ./scripts/substitute.sh
```

## 6. :mag:&nbsp; **Verify** all the above files have the correct information present

## 7. :closed_lock_with_key:&nbsp; Encrypt secrets with SOPS

> :round_pushpin: Variables defined in `cluster-secrets.yaml` and `cluster-settings.yaml` will be
> usable anywhere in your YAML manifests under `./cluster`

### Create deploy key

Create sops secret in `cluster/base/flux-system/github-deploy-key.sops.yaml` following
[template](../kubernetes/bootstrap/github-deploy-key.sops.yaml.example)

### Encrypting with SOPS

General procedure:

```sh
# Encrypt SOPS secrets
sops --encrypt --in-place /path/to/unencrypted_secrets.sops.yaml
```

To run for all templates in repo:

```sh
bash ./scripts/sops.sh
```

## 8. :mag:&nbsp; **Verify** all the above files are **encrypted** with SOPS

## 9. Push your changes to git

```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push
```

## 10. Install Flux

Apply deploy-key and sops-age secrets to cluster

```sh
cat "${SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE}" |
    kubectl -n flux-system create secret generic sops-age --from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin
sops -d cluster/flux/flux-system/github-deploy-key.sops.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Apply bootstrap and cluster kustomizations & force reconciliation

```sh
kubectl apply --kustomize ./cluster/bootstrap/
kubectl apply --kustomize ./cluster/flux/flux-system/
flux reconcile -n flux-system source git flux-cluster
flux reconcile -n flux-system kustomization flux-cluster
```

## Verify Flux

Verify

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig=${KUBECONFIG} get pods -n flux-system
flux --kubeconfig=${KUBECONFIG} get sources git
```

Manually sync Flux with your Git repository

```sh
task cluster:reconcile
```

Check status

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig=${KUBECONFIG} get kustomization -A
flux --kubeconfig=${KUBECONFIG} get helmrelease -A
```

> For objects that have been preinstalled with ansible, we patch to allow helm to manage
> [tigera-operator](../cluster/core/tigera-operator/give_helm_ownership.sh)

## Verify ingress

If your cluster is not accessible to outside world you can provide a dns override for
`https://homer.${BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN}` in your router

<!-- or update your hosts
file to verify the ingress controller is working.

```sh
echo "${BOOTSTRAP_LB_INGRESS} ${BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN} homer.${BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN}" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
``` -->

Head over to your browser and you _should_ be able to access `https://homer.${BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN}`

## üì£ Post installation

### üåê DNS

üìç [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) will handle creating public DNS records.
By default, `echo-server` is the only public domain exposed on your Cloudflare domain.
In order to make additional applications public you must set an ingress annotation (see HelmRelease for `echo-server`).
Note: This is not required unless you need a record outside the purposes of your Kubernetes cluster (e.g. setting up MX records).

[k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) is deployed on the IP choosen for `${LB_GATEWAY}`.
In order to test DNS you can point your client's DNS to the `${LB_GATEWAY}` IP address and load a deployed app in your browser.

You can also try debugging with the command `dig`, e.g. `dig @${LB_GATEWAY} <app_name>.${SECRET_DOMAIN}`
and you should get a valid answer containing your `${LB_INGRESS}` IP address.

If your router (or Pi-Hole, Adguard Home or whatever) supports conditional DNS forwarding (aka split-horizon DNS),
you may have DNS requests for `${SECRET_DOMAIN}` only point to the  `${LB_GATEWAY}` IP address.
This will ensure only DNS requests for `${SECRET_DOMAIN}` will only get routed to your [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway)
service, providing DNS resolution to your cluster applications/ingresses.

To access services from the outside world, use Cloudflare Tunnels (formerly Argo Tunnel),
or port forward `80` and `443` in your router to the `${LB_INGRESS}` IP.
This _should_ provide access `https://echo-server.${BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN}` from a device outside your LAN.

Of course, if nothing is working, that is expected. This is DNS after all!

### ü§ñ Renovate

[Renovate](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate) is a very useful
tool that when configured will start to create PRs in your Github repository when Docker images,
Helm charts or anything else that can be tracked has a newer version. The configuration for
renovate is located [here](./.github/renovate.json5).

To enable Renovate, click the 'Configure' button over at their [Github app page](https://github.com/apps/renovate)
and choose your repository. Over time Renovate will create PRs for out-of-date dependencies it finds.
Flux will deploy any merged PRs.

There are several Github workflows included in this repository that help automate some processes.

- [Renovate schedule](./.github/workflows/schedule-renovate.yaml) - workflow to annotate `HelmRelease`'s which allows
  Renovate to track Helm chart versions.
- [Megalinter](./.github/workflows/megalinter.yaml) - workflow to lint so cluster specifications
  remain properly formatted
- [Helm differ](./.github/workflows/helm-release-differ.yaml) - workflow to annotate PRs with the differences in helm files
  _NOTE:_ this requires [creating a private github bot](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#authenticating-with-github-app-generated-tokens)

### ü™ù Github Webhook

Flux is pull-based by design meaning it will periodically check your git repository for changes;
instead, using a webhook can enable Flux to update the cluster on `git push`.
In order to configure Github to send `push` events from your repository to the Flux webhook receiver you will need:

1. Webhook URL - Your webhook receiver will be deployed on `https://flux-webhook.${SECRET_DOMAIN}/hook/:hookId`.
   In order to find out your hook id you can run the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get receiver/github-receiver --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig
    # NAME              AGE    READY   STATUS
    # github-receiver   6h8m   True    Receiver initialized with URL: /hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123
    ```

    So if my domain was `testdomain.com`, the full url would look like this:

    ```text
    https://flux-webhook.testdomain.com/hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123
    ```

2. Webhook secret - Generate the secret token and populate the secret

   ```sh
   TOKEN=$(head -c 12 /dev/urandom | shasum | cut -d ' ' -f1)
   echo $TOKEN
   ```

    **Note:** Don't forget to update the `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` variable in your `.envrc` file
    and run `envsubst ...` ands `sops ...` to create the encrypted secret

Now that you have the webhook url and secret, it's time to set everything up on the Github repository side.
Navigate to the settings of your repository on Github, under "Settings/Webhooks" press the "Add webhook" button.
Fill in the webhook url and your secret.
