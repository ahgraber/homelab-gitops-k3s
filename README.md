# Template for deploying k3s backed by Flux

Template for deploying a single [k3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster with [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup) backed by [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) and [SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/).

The purpose here is to showcase how you can deploy an entire Kubernetes cluster and show it off to the world using the [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really) tool [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/). When completed, your Git repository will be driving the state of your Kubernetes cluster. In addition with the help of the [Flux SOPS integration](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/) you'll be able to commit GPG encrypted secrets to your public repo.

### :warning:&nbsp; pre-commit

It is advisable to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and the pre-commit hooks that come with this repository.
[sops-pre-commit](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/sops-pre-commit) will check to make sure you are not by accident commiting your secrets un-encrypted.

After pre-commit is installed on your machine run:

```sh
pre-commit install-hooks
```

## :open_file_folder:&nbsp; Repository structure

The Git repository contains the following directories under `cluster` and are ordered below by how Flux will apply them.

- **base** directory is the entrypoint to Flux
- **crds** directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in your cluster before anything else exists
- **core** directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by Flux
- **apps** directory (depends on **core**) is where your common applications (grouped by namespace) could be placed, Flux will prune resources here if they are not tracked by Git anymore

```
cluster
├── apps
│   ├── default
│   ├── networking
│   └── system-upgrade
├── base
│   └── flux-system
├── core
│   ├── cert-manager
│   ├── metallb-system
│   ├── namespaces
│   └── system-upgrade
└── crds
    └── cert-manager
```

## :rocket:&nbsp; Lets go!

Very first step will be to create a new repository by clicking the **Use this template** button on this page.

:round_pushpin: In these instructions you will be exporting several environment variables to your current shell env. Make sure you stay with in your current shell to not lose any exported variables.

:round_pushpin: **All of the below commands** are run on your **local** workstation, **not** on any of your cluster nodes. 

### :closed_lock_with_key:&nbsp; Setting up GnuPG keys

:round_pushpin: Here we will create a personal and a Flux GPG key. Using SOPS with GnuPG allows us to encrypt and decrypt secrets.

1. Create a Personal GPG Key, password protected, and export the fingerprint. It's **strongly encouraged** to back up this key somewhere safe so you don't lose it.

```sh
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export PERSONAL_KEY_NAME="First name Last name (location) <email>"

gpg --batch --full-generate-key <<EOF
Key-Type: 1
Key-Length: 4096
Subkey-Type: 1
Subkey-Length: 4096
Expire-Date: 0
Name-Real: ${PERSONAL_KEY_NAME}
EOF

gpg --list-secret-keys "${PERSONAL_KEY_NAME}"
# pub   rsa4096 2021-03-11 [SC]
#       772154FFF783DE317KLCA0EC77149AC618D75581
# uid           [ultimate] k8s@home (Macbook) <k8s-at-home@gmail.com>
# sub   rsa4096 2021-03-11 [E]

export PERSONAL_KEY_FP=772154FFF783DE317KLCA0EC77149AC618D75581
```

2. Create a Flux GPG Key and export the fingerprint

```sh
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export FLUX_KEY_NAME="Cluster name (Flux) <email>"

gpg --batch --full-generate-key <<EOF
%no-protection
Key-Type: 1
Key-Length: 4096
Subkey-Type: 1
Subkey-Length: 4096
Expire-Date: 0
Name-Real: ${FLUX_KEY_NAME}
EOF

gpg --list-secret-keys "${FLUX_KEY_NAME}"
# pub   rsa4096 2021-03-11 [SC]
#       AB675CE4CC64251G3S9AE1DAA88ARRTY2C009E2D
# uid           [ultimate] Home cluster (Flux) <k8s-at-home@gmail.com>
# sub   rsa4096 2021-03-11 [E]

export FLUX_KEY_FP=AB675CE4CC64251G3S9AE1DAA88ARRTY2C009E2D
```

### :sailboat:&nbsp; Installing k3s with k3sup

:round_pushpin: Here we will be install [k3s](https://k3s.io/) with [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup). After completion, k3sup will drop a `kubeconfig` in your present working directory for use with interacting with your cluster with `kubectl`.

1. Ensure you are able to SSH into you nodes with using your private ssh key. This is how k3sup is able to connect to your remote node.

2. Install the master node

```sh
k3sup install \
    --host=169.254.1.1 \
    --user=k8s-at-home \
    --k3s-version=v1.20.5+k3s1 \
    --k3s-extra-args="--disable servicelb --disable traefik"
```

3. Join worker nodes (optional)

```sh
k3sup join \
    --host=169.254.1.2 \
    --server-host=169.254.1.1 \
    --k3s-version=v1.20.5+k3s1 \
    --user=k8s-at-home
```

4. Verify the nodes are online
   
```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig get nodes
# NAME           STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
# k8s-master-a   Ready    control-plane,master      4d20h   v1.20.5+k3s1
# k8s-worker-a   Ready    worker                    4d20h   v1.20.5+k3s1
```

### :cloud:&nbsp; Cloudflare API Token

:round_pushpin: You may skip this step, **however** make sure to `export` dummy data **on item 8** in the below list.

...Be aware you **will not** have a valid SSL cert until cert-manager is configured correctly

In order to use cert-manager with the Cloudflare DNS challenge you will need to create a API token.

1. Head over to Cloudflare and create a API token by going [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
2. Click the blue `Create Token` button
3. Scroll down and create a Custom Token by choosing `Get started`
4. Give your token a name like `cert-manager`
5. Under `Permissions` give **read** access to `Zone` : `Zone` and **write** access to `Zone` : `DNS`
6. Under `Zone Resources` set it to `Include` : `All Zones`
7. Click `Continue to summary` and then `Create Token`
8. Export this token and your Cloudflare email address to an environment variable on your system to be used in the following steps

```sh
export BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL="k8s-at-home@gmail.com"
export BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN="kpG6iyg3FS_du_8KRShdFuwfbwu3zMltbvmJV6cD"
```

### :small_blue_diamond:&nbsp; GitOps with Flux

:round_pushpin: Here we will be installing [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) after some quick bootstrap steps.

1. Verify Flux can be installed

```sh
flux --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig check --pre
# ► checking prerequisites
# ✔ kubectl 1.21.0 >=1.18.0-0
# ✔ Kubernetes 1.20.5+k3s1 >=1.16.0-0
# ✔ prerequisites checks passed
```

2. Pre-create the `flux-system` namespace

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig create namespace flux-system --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig apply -f -
```

3. Add the Flux GPG key in-order for Flux to decrypt SOPS secrets

```sh
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor "${FLUX_KEY_FP}" |
kubectl --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig create secret generic sops-gpg \
    --namespace=flux-system \
    --from-file=sops.asc=/dev/stdin
```

4. Export more environment variables for application configuration

```sh
# The repo you created from this template
export BOOTSTRAP_GITHUB_REPOSITORY="https://github.com/k8s-at-home/home-cluster"
# Choose one of your domains or use a made up one
export BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN="k8s-at-home.com"
# Pick a range of unused IPs that are on the same network as your nodes
export BOOTSTRAP_METALLB_LB_RANGE="169.254.1.10-169.254.1.20"
# The load balancer IP for ingress-nginx, choose from one of the available IPs above
export BOOTSTRAP_INGRESS_NGINX_LB="169.254.1.10"
```

5. Create required files based on ALL exported environment variables.

```sh
envsubst < ./tmpl/.sops.yaml > ./.sops.yaml
envsubst < ./tmpl/cluster-secrets.sops.yaml > ./cluster/base/cluster-secrets.sops.yaml
envsubst < ./tmpl/cluster-settings.yaml > ./cluster/base/cluster-settings.yaml
envsubst < ./tmpl/gotk-sync.yaml > ./cluster/base/flux-system/gotk-sync.yaml
envsubst < ./tmpl/secret.sops.yaml > ./cluster/core/cert-manager/secret.sops.yaml
```

6. **Verify** all the above files have the correct information present

7. Encrypt `cluster/cluster-secrets.sops.yaml` and `cert-manager/secret.sops.yaml` with SOPS

```sh
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
sops --encrypt --in-place ./cluster/base/cluster-secrets.sops.yaml
sops --encrypt --in-place ./cluster/core/cert-manager/secret.sops.yaml
```

:round_pushpin: Variables defined in `cluster-secrets.sops.yaml` and `cluster-settings.sops.yaml` will be usable anywhere in your YAML manifests under `./cluster`

8. **Verify** all the above files are **encrypted** with SOPS

9. Push you changes to git

```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push
```

10. Install Flux

:round_pushpin: Due to race conditions with the Flux CRDs you will have to run the below command twice. There should be no errors on this second run.

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig apply --kustomize=./cluster/base/flux-system
# namespace/flux-system configured
# customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alerts.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created

```

:tada: **Congratulations** you have a Kubernetes cluster managed by Flux, your Git repository is driving the state of your cluster.

## :mega:&nbsp; Post installation

### Verify Flux

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig get pods -n flux-system
# NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# helm-controller-5bbd94c75-89sb4            1/1     Running   0          1h
# kustomize-controller-7b67b6b77d-nqc67      1/1     Running   0          1h
# notification-controller-7c46575844-k4bvr   1/1     Running   0          1h
# source-controller-7d6875bcb4-zqw9f         1/1     Running   0          1h
```

### Verify ingress

If your cluster is not accessible to outside world you can update your hosts file to verify the ingress controller is working.

```sh
echo "${BOOTSTRAP_INGRESS_NGINX_LB} ${BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN} homer.${BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN}" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Head over to your browser and you _should_ be able to access `https://homer.${BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN}`

### direnv

This is a great tool to export environment variables depending on what your present working directory is, head over to their [installation guide](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) and don't forget to hook it into your shell!

When this is done you no longer have to use `--kubeconfig=./kubeconfig` in your `kubectl`, `flux` or `helm` commands.

### VSCode SOPS extension

[VSCode SOPS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=signageos.signageos-vscode-sops) is a neat little plugin for those using VSCode.
It will automatically decrypt you SOPS secrets when you click on the file in the editor and encrypt them when you save  and exit the file.

### :point_right:&nbsp; Debugging

### :robot:&nbsp; Automation

- [Renovate](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate) is a very useful tool that when configured will start to create PRs in your Github repository when Docker images, Helm charts or anything else that can be tracked has a newer version. The configuration for renovate is located [here](./.github/renovate.json5).

- [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) will watch for new k3s releases and upgrade your nodes when new releases are found.

There's also a couple Github workflows included in this repository that will help automate some processes.

- [Flux upgrade schedule](./.github/workflows/flux-schedule.yaml) - workflow to upgrade Flux.
- [Renovate schedule](./.github/workflows/renovate-schedule.yaml) - workflow to annotate `HelmRelease`'s which allows [Renovate](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate) to track Helm chart versions.

## :grey_question:&nbsp; What's next

The world is your cluster, try installing another application or if you have a NAS and want storage back by that check out the helm charts for [democratic-csi](https://github.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi), [csi-driver-nfs](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs) or [nfs-subdir-external-provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner).

If you plan on exposing your ingress to the world from your home. Checkout [our rough guide](https://docs.k8s-at-home.com/guides/dyndns/) to run a k8s `CronJob` to update DDNS.
