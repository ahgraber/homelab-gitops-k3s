# This ConfigMap is just a way to define the cloudflared config.yaml file in k8s.
# It's useful to define it in k8s, rather than as a stand-alone .yaml file, because
# this lets you use various k8s templating solutions (e.g. Helm charts) to
# parameterize your config, instead of just using string literals.

    ingress:
    ### Proxy traefik to the k8s ingress (Traefik) to hand off to Services
    # internet --> cloudflared tunnel --> local DNS --> ingress --> service
    ### NOTE: relies on split-brain DNS / local overrides
    - hostname: httpbin.${SECRET_DOMAIN}
      service: https://httpbin.${SECRET_DOMAIN}
    - hostname: hammond.${SECRET_DOMAIN}
      service: https://hammond.${SECRET_DOMAIN}

    # - hostname: baikal.${SECRET_DOMAIN}
    #   service: https://baikal.${SECRET_DOMAIN}
    # - hostname: vaultwarden.${SECRET_DOMAIN}
    #   service: https://vaultwarden.${SECRET_DOMAIN}


    ### Proxy traffic to the k8s Services directly
    - hostname: flux-receiver.${SECRET_DOMAIN}
      service: http://webhook-receiver.flux-system:80

    # This rule sends traffic to the built-in hello-world HTTP server. This can help debug connectivity issues.
    # If hello.${SECRET_DOMAIN} resolves and <service>.${SECRET_DOMAIN} does not, then the problem is
    # in the connection from cloudflared to your local service, not from the internet to cloudflared.
    - hostname: "hello.${SECRET_DOMAIN}"
      service: hello_world

    ### "Else" rule matches any traffic which didn't match a previous rule, and responds with HTTP 404.
    - service: http_status:404
