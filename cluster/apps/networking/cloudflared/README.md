# Cloudflare

## Argo Tunnel

Cloudflare Tunnel provides you with a secure way to connect your resources to Cloudflare
without a publicly routable IP address. With Tunnel, you do not send traffic to an external IP â€”
instead, a lightweight daemon in your infrastructure (cloudflared) creates outbound-only
connections to Cloudflare's edge.

### Prerequisites

- [cloudflared CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide#1-download-and-install-cloudflared)

### Deploying for k8s application

[github example docs](https://github.com/cloudflare/argo-tunnel-examples/tree/master/named-tunnel-k8s)
[documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/many-cfd-one-tunnel#deploy-cloudflared)

1. If you haven't, login to you Cloudflare account to obtain a certificate.

   ```sh
   cloudflared tunnel login
   ```

2. Create a tunnel, change example-tunnel to the name you want to assign to your tunnel.

   <!-- markdownlint-disable -->
   ```sh
   $ cloudflared tunnel create example-tunnel
   INFO[2020-09-05T10:48:34+01:00] Writing tunnel credentials to /Users/cf000197/.cloudflared/ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad.json. cloudflared chose this file based on where your origin certificate was found.
   INFO[2020-09-05T10:48:34+01:00] Keep this file secret. To revoke these credentials, delete the tunnel.
   INFO[2020-09-05T10:48:34+01:00] Created tunnel example-tunnel with id ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad
   ```

3. Upload the tunnel credentials file to your Kubernetes as a secret. You'll need to provide the filepath
   that the tunnel credentials file was created under.
   You can find that path in the output of cloudflared tunnel create above.

   ```sh
   $ kubectl create secret generic tunnel-credentials \
   --from-file=credentials.json=/Users/cf000197/.cloudflared/ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad.json
   ```

4. Associate your Tunnel with a DNS record. Go to dashboard and create a CNAME targeting .cfargotunnel.com.
   In this example the tunnel ID is ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad, so I will create CNAME targeting
   ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad.cfargotunnel.com.
   You can create multiple CNAME records targeting the same tunnel.

   You can do this from the command line by running `cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel> <hostname>`. For example,

   ```sh
   cloudflared tunnel route dns example-tunnel tunnel.example.com.
   ```

5. Deploy cloudflared by applying its manifest.
   This will start a Deployment for running cloudflared and a ConfigMap with cloudflared's config.
   When Cloudflare receives traffic for the DNS or Load Balancing hostname you configured in the previous step,
   it will send that traffic to the cloudflareds running in this deployment.
   Those cloudflared instances will proxy the request to your app's Service.

   ```sh
   $ kubectl apply -f cloudflared.yaml
   deployment.apps/cloudflared created
   configmap/cloudflared configured
   ```

6. Examine status of the pod.

   <!-- markdownlint-disable -->
   ```sh
   $ kubectl get pods
   NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   cloudflared-57746f77fd-frc99          1/1     Running   0          12m
   cloudflared-57746f77fd-xht8n          1/1     Running   0          12m
   httpbin-deployment-67f749774f-42tqj   1/1     Running   0          20h

   $ kubectl logs $(kubectl get pod -l app=cloudflared -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
