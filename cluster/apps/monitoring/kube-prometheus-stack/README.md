# [kube-prometheus stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack#kube-prometheus-stack/)

Installs the kube-prometheus stack, a collection of Kubernetes manifests, Grafana dashboards, and
Prometheus rules combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy to operate end-to-end
Kubernetes cluster monitoring with Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud.
Prometheus collects and stores _metrics_ as time series data, i.e. metrics information
is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.
