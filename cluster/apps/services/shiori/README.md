Shiori is a simple bookmarks manager written in the Go language, intended as a simple clone of Pocket.

## [Usage](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/blob/master/docs/Usage.md)

Initial login & setup with:

```txt
username: shiori
password: gopher
```

The first new account added will become the owner & will deactivate the `shiori:gopher` default user automatically.

## Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets have been deprecated but FireFox (and Chrome?) extensions are available.
