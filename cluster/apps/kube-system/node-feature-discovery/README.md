[Documentation](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html)

Node Feature Discovery manages the detection of hardware features and configuration
in a Kubernetes cluster by labeling the nodes with hardware-specific information.
Node Feature Discovery (NFD) will label the host with node-specific attributes,
like PCI cards, kernel, or OS version, and more.
