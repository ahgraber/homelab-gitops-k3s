[Crunchydata postgres operator](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) creates highly available databases

The Operator will watch the specified namespace(s) in the
_kubernetes cluster_ for additions/revisions to _postgres cluster_ manifests,
which define databases and associated users, permissions, configuration, etc.
