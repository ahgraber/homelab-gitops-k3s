# [lldap](https://github.com/lldap/lldap)

A lightweight authentication server that provides an opinionated, _simplified LDAP interface for authentication_ - LLDAP does not provide a full LDAP server. It comes with a frontend that makes user management easy, and allows users to edit their own details or reset their password by email.

Refer to [LLDAP's configuration file](https://github.com/lldap/lldap/blob/main/lldap_config.docker_template.toml);
config variables are prefixed with `LLDAP_` or `LLDAP_<SECTION>_` when passed as env vars.
