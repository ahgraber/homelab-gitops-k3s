# [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/)

Loki (by Grafana) is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus.
It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate.
It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.
