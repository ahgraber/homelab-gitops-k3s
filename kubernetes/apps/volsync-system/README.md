# [VolSync](https://volsync.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

VolSync is a Kubernetes operator that performs asynchronous replication of persistent volumes within/across clusters.
The replication provided by VolSync is independent of the storage system.
This allows replication to and from storage types that don't normally support remote replication.
Additionally, it can replicate across different types (and vendors) of storage.

## Use

See [volsync templates readme](../../templates/volsync/README.md) for use.
