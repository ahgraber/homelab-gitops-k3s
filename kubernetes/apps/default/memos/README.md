## Storage

Memos is currently using postgres for storage -- including files and images.
This is suggested for when text > image content.  If lots of images or video are added, consider changing to S3.

See [Choosing a Storage for Your Resource: Database, S3 or Local Storage? - Memos](https://www.usememos.com/blog/choosing-a-storage-for-your-resource) for more info.
