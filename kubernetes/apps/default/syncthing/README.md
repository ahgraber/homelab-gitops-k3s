# [Syncthing](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/index.html)

Syncthing is a continuous P2P (peer to peer) file synchronization program.
It synchronizes files between _n_ computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes.
Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it's transmitted over the internet.
