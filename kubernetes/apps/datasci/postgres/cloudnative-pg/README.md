# CloudNative Postgres

CloudNative Postgres uses an Operator to watch for new database cluster- and backup- definitions
as provided by CRDs.

## Operator

The operator is deployed via helm release

## Cluster & Backups

S3-compatible storage can be used as a live WAL backup.
Since the native PVC/PV is using k8s-local local-path, the backup should use NAS-based s3.

## Restore

> On versioning:
> If you end up with an older cloudnative pg backup (i.e. i have a pg14 one) but you're using a
> newer operator that defaults to newer (i.e. > 15.1), you wont be able to restore as it will whine about versions.
> Add an image tag to the cluster spec to deploy a second cluster with a specifically downgraded ver to restore
> without having to juggle around changing the operator helm etc

## CLI

Install the [kubectl plugin](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/cnpg-plugin/)

## Updating postgres versions with CNPG

1. Scale down apps using old cluster
2. Ensure old cluster is running
3. Spin up new cluster, pointing `.connectionParameters` to the old cluster
4. Ensure new cluster has a scheduledBackup pointing to it
5. Redirect `ext-postgres-operator` to new cluster (edit the cluster fqdn in the secret)
6. Redirect apps to new cluster
7. Scale up apps ü§ûüèº
8. Remove the old cluster
